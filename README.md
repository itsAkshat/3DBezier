# 3DBezier
The following project report is demonstration of the working of the code that offers a different approach on modeling surfaces and 
solids in MATLAB using two 2-Dimensional Bezier curves to produce a 3-Dimensional surface. 
One curve acts as the guide and the other curve acts as the cross section of the surface to formed.

Running the code (APlot.m) on MATLAB will take in your inputs in nulmber of control points for each curve and then the coordinates for 
the respective control points.

The result window will be a 3D plot of the curve, (This is only a 3D plot of many cross sectional 3D curves and not an actual 3D solid)
